# Implementation of topic modeling in Industry

Topic modeling is a part of natural language processing (NLP) which enables end-users to identify themes and topics within a collection of documents. It has applications in multiple industries for text mining and gaining relevant insights from textual data. This talk will cover the math behind topic modeling, one example of extracting topics from a sample data and how the user can leverage these outcomes to take actionable insights. This talk will also discuss the necessary infrastructure for an enterprise-wide product and how multiple teams collaborate together on such solutions.

## Data Architecture
There are a lot of pieces involved while designing an end-to-end solution. One such example is shown in the following architecture.

## Data


source, EDA, data cleaning/processing

## Topic modeling algorithms

### LDA

## Example results

The output of LDA can be also saved in the following way. This can be used if 
the requirement is that the end users want to drill down into each of the comments
details. This could be fed into one of the data visualization platforms like
MS Power BI or Tableau to provide the end users with usable dashboards.
