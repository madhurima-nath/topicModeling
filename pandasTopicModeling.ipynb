It has applications in multiple industries for text mining and gaining relevant insights from textual data. This talk will cover the math behind topic modeling, one example of extracting topics from a sample data and how the user can leverage these outcomes to take actionable insights. This talk will also discuss the necessary infrastructure for an enterprise-wide product and how multiple teams collaborate together on such solutions."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Topic modeling is a technique for determining the topics in a document. It can ve also used to discover patterns of words in a collection of documents. Analysing the frequency of words and phrases in the documents determines the probability of a word or phrase belonging to a certain topic and cluster documents based on their similarity or closeness.\n\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised clustering technique that is commonly used for text analysis. Here, words are represented as topics and documents are collection of these word topics.

As a consequence, finding relevant articles has become more difficult. Tagging or topic modelling provides a way to give token of identification to research articles which facilitates recommendation and search process.\n\nGiven the abstract and title for a set of research articles, predict the topics for each article included in the test set.\n\nNote that a research article can possibly have more than 1 topic.
